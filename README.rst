Vial editor
###########

What about snaked?
==================

I've realized I'll never reimplement even a small subset of VIM features.

Snaked is good for me for its action contexts and overall feel. But
gtksourceviewâ€¦ It suits only for notepad clones. Painfully slow, creepy
syntax highlight spec, unusable buffer/view separation.

More over there is a bunch of excellent plugins for VIM. I want to have this
functionality in my editor but have no time.


Why not just GVIM?
==================

I want fancy GUI popups and ability to extend editor in normal language.


Do you know about PIDA and a8?
==============================

Yeah. These projects try to bury VIM power under feeble decorations.


What Vial is and what it is not
===============================

Features which will be borrowed from snaked:
--------------------------------------------

- Sessions and projects.

- Actions menu.

- External tools.

- Quick open dialog.

- Outline dialog.

Integration with VIM:
---------------------

- Per-session VIM settings.

- xptemplate.

- Omni-completion.

- Buffer list.

- Window list.

- High level python api.

- Console, python repl and test runner will be implemented as usual vim buffers
  So one can arrange them in any window layout. 

- (?) Supplement will provide omnifunc for plain VIM users. 

That's all.
