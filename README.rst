Vial
####

Snaked feel on a top of VIM.

What about snaked?
==================

I've realized I'll never reimplement even a small subset of VIM features.

Snaked is good for me for its action contexts and overall feel. But
gtksourceviewâ€¦ It suits only for notepad clones. Painfully slow, creepy
syntax highlight spec, unusable buffer/view separation.

More over there is a bunch of excellent plugins for VIM. I want to have this
functionality in my editor but have no time.


What Vial is and what it is not
===============================

A wrapper around vimscript to develop plugins in python.
Also Vial will contain reimplementation of following snaked futures:

- Sessions (support for native VIM sessions) and projects.

- Actions menu.

- External tools.

- Quick open dialog.

- Outline dialog.

- Buffer list.

- Integration with supplement.

- Python scratchpad.

- Pytest support.

- Bad code (python) save preventer.

Simple, huh?
