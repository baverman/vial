PLUGIN STRUCTURE                                 *vial-plugin-structure*

The basic structure repeats an ordinary VIM plugin. You can use the same
directories (syntax, color, ftdetect, doc, ftplugin and so on). The only
difference is a "vial-plugin" dir. You should put your python code
there.
>
    hello-world/
        README.md
        LICENSE
        doc/
            hello-world.txt
        vial-plugin/
            hello_world/
                __init__.py
<
Note: "vial-plugin" contains a top-level package "hello_world".

Vial scans 'rtp' for "vial-plugin" directories and tries to load top
level packages as plugins. So, vial plugins are pathogen (and other PM)
friendly and you can manage plugins (enable/disable) with your favorite
tools.
